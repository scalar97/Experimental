hierachy: list all the game objects in the file. When you attach one object to another, when you move one object the rest of its children follow. a bit like rotating grouped objects.

pivot: move the object through its anchor point rather than its center.
Global: a bit like the north, south, east west in the world
local coordinates: the forward, side , backwared of the object.

Material place: cutomises the look of the object. e. albito to drag and drop color.
Assets: open C sharp project. 

start(): gets called once, at object creation
update(): gets called at each frame.

Unity classes:
Entity component model.  You do not extend game object, you extend monobihaviour. to add new functionality, create a subclass of monobihaviour

Render: render stuff: 
1. trail render: render trails, e.g brain's wandering around creatures follow trails
2. line render: object that follow a line
3. mesh render: object that are 3d

Lerp function
lerp(a,b,t) = a+(b-a)*t
if t is 0.1 and a kfhffuutd ggfggfh ou, it will always move 10% closer.

Exam question:
Entity component model.
