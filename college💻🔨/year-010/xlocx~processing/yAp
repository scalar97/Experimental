Mad has decided to catch a vulture
the biggest bird she can find
 
She is so determined and so inventive
that by stringing together a rickety trap
of ropes and sticks she creates
a puzzling structure that just might
be clever enough to trick a buzzard
once the trap’s baited with leftover pork
from supper
 
Mad and I used to do everything together
but now I need a project all my own
so I roam the green fields
finding bones
 
The skull of a wild boar
The jawbone of a mule
 
Older cousins show me
how to shake the mule’s quijada
to make the blunt teeth
rattle
 
Guitars
Drums
Gourds
Sticks
 
A cow bell
A washboard
Pretty soon we have
a whole orchestra
 
On Cuban farms even death
can turn into
music
